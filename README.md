Multi-dimensional Dynamic Geometry Model (MDGM)


Multi-dimensional Dynamic Geometry Model (MDGM)

MDGM is a model designed to simulate and analyze dynamic systems involving complex spatial interactions and geometries. It integrates multi-dimensional Penrose tiling, dynamic all-star shapes, metric grids, and fractal structures.

Overview:

MDGM features:

Dynamic Geometric Transformations: Using Penrose tiling and all-star shapes.
Metric and Fractal Grids: For navigating and optimizing within complex environments.
Setup:

This model requires a programming environment capable of handling vector calculations and advanced data structures. Python with NumPy and Matplotlib is recommended for ease of use and visualization.
